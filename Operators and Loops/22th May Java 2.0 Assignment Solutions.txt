1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans: They aJe used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression. For instance/ if we want to
print a number only if it is greater than 2 and less than 5/ then we will use conditional opeJatoJs to combine the 2 expJessions. We have 3 types of conditional opeJatoJs - logical-and/ logical-oJ and ternary Operator.
Logical-and operator (&&)
It is used when we want the condition to be true iff both the expression are true.
Syntax

Logical-or operator (||)
This opeJatoJ is used when we aJe satisfied as long as any one of the boolean exprssion is evaluated as true.
Syntax

Ternary operator (?:)
It is a smaller version for the if-else statement. If the condition is true then the statement - 1 is executed else the
statement - 2 is executed.
Syntax
condition ? statement - 1  statement - 2;

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: TheJe aJe thJee types of opeJatoJs in java based on the numbeJ of opeJands. They aJe
- Unary Operator
- Binary Operator
- Ternary Operator
.
3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans: Switch statement
The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks for execution.
Break keyword: As java reaches a break keyword/ the control break out of the switch block. The execution of code stops on encountering this keyword/ and the case testing inside the block ends as the match is found. A lot of execution time can be saved because it ignores the rest of the code's execution when there is a break.
Default keyword The keyword is used to specify the code executed when the expression does not match any test case.
The switch case in Java works like an if-else ladder/ i.e./ multiple conditions can be checked at once. Switch is
provided with an expression that can be a constant of literal expression that can be evaluated. The value of the
expression is matched with each test case till a match is found. If there is no match/ the default keywoJd/ if
specified- the associated code executes. OtheJwise/ the code specified foJ the matched test case is executed.

For example:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int month = 4;
switch (month) {
case 1:
System.out.println("January");
break;
case 2:
System.out.println("February");
break;
case 3:
System.out.println("March");
break;
case 4:
System.out.println("April");
break;
case 5:
System.out.println("May");
break;
case 6:
System.out.println("June");
break;
default: System.out.println("In next half");
}
}
}
Output:
April

4. What are the priority levels of arithmatic operations in Java?
Ans. There are two priority levels of arithematic oprations in java. They are as follows:
High Priority *,/,%.
Low Priority +,-

5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans. If to specify a block of clode to be executed if a specified condition in true.
- else ot ospecify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false;
- else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
- switch of specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans. if (condition1) {
// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}



7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
There are three types of loops in Java.
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop

9. Write a program to print numUers from 1 to 10.

public class PrintNumbers
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
for(int i=1; i<=10; i++)
{
System.out.println(i);
}
}
}
